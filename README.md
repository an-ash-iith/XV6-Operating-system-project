# XV6-Operating-system-project
This project involves enhancing the MIT XV6 operating system by adding custom functionalities. I have modified the kernel code of XV6 to implement multithreading, file system utilities, and paging. Additionally, I have introduced dirty bit detection, metadata tracking, and copy-on-write mechanisms, which are not present in the vanilla XV6.
